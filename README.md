## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me enhance my skills in responsive design using only HTML and CSS. I focused on creating a layout using Flexbox and Grid to structure the page, while ensuring the dropdown navigation was styled effectively using only CSS.

I also learned how to design the dropdown navigation for mobile using CSS, by toggling the menu visibility with CSS classes based on viewport size.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Improve the design by adding CSS transitions for a smoother dropdown menu interaction.
- Experiment with different layout strategies to handle larger projects.
